## How to use:
### Steps:
* Initialize
* Show ads

## Installation
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Add the dependency

```
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.p32929:HouseAds2:1.0.0.16'
	}
```

## Code Example:
### Initialization:

If you just want to show interstitial ads , initialize like this:

```
HouseAds houseAds = new HouseAds(this,
                "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p32929/SomeHowTosAndTexts/master/HouseAdsJson/house_ads2.json"
        );
```

If you want to show both interstitial ads and banner ads, initialize like this:

```
HouseAds houseAds = new HouseAds(this,
                "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p32929/SomeHowTosAndTexts/master/HouseAdsJson/house_ads2.json",
                linearLayout
        );
```

To show interstitial ad on back press:

```
houseAds.showInterAds();
```
The banner ad will be added on the json data load.

If you want to change the banner ads every `n` seconds:

```
houseAds.autoChangeBannerAds(seconds);
```

If you want to show a Rating Dialog before sending the user to the Google Play Store, you need to set a feedback email using `setFeedbackEmail` method like this:

```
houseAds.setFeedbackEmail("p32929@gmail.com");
```

The JSON data should be like this:
```
